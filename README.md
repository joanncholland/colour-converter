# Colour Converter
This is a program that allows the user to select the type of colour they'd like to convert from and to, then enter the value they'd like to convert and displays the result. After about a second, a prompt appears asking whether they'd like to generate a colour scheme from that colour. If they click no, the prompt disappears. If they click yes, the colour scheme generator appears, where they can select the type of colour scheme and how many colours they want. 

There are still a few things to fix, such as some minor styling and adding validation of entering a correct colour value. I may come back to it in the future, but this was a practice project for using jQuery, an API, and JavaScript.
